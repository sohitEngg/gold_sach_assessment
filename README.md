# gold_sach_assessment
An assessment, I am trying my best to present my mobile development skills.

## Framework and library used 
- With this assignment I explored Jetpack Compose for the first time, feeling bit confident now. I belive this is not the best I can improve it a lot :)
- Retrofit for API services
- ViewModel for presentation logic
- Okhttp for caching mechanism
- Composable plugins for UI rendering, loving it!

## Demo
Here below is the video that I have captured for demonstration, please take a look.
